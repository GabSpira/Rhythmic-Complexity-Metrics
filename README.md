# Rhythmic Complexity Metrics Comparison
 Algorithmic computation of rhythmic complexity metrics for MSc Thesis in Rhythmic Complexity Perception

Run the main.py file to compute 35 rhythmic complexity measures
(you can select the pattern you want to analyze at line 22, which takes one of three options, each loaded from a dataset among the Povel & Essens, Essens and Fitch & Rosenfeld ones)
